# CUBI12 - API
API RESTful used as backend for Cubi12 software using .NET 7 and mySQL.

Cubi12 is (currently) an open source project to help students at UCN (Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte) at Chile to understand all the subjects they can take and their progress in the career.

## Prerequisites

- SDK [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download/dotnet/7.0).
- Port 5000 Available
- git [2.33.0](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or higher.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Is highly recommended to see the steps to install correctly docker on your machine: [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [MacOs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```
3. Change directory to the "Cubitwelve" folder, where the main application code is located.
   ```bash
   cd Cubitwelve
   ```

4. Inside the folder Cubitwelve exists a file called *.env.development* change their name to *.env* and then fill the fields with the right values, this is an example:
    ```bash
    DB_USER=my_epic_user
    DB_PASSWORD=my_secret_password
    DB_DATABASE=my_db
    DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=my_secret_root_password
    ```
    You can use whatever credentials you want

4. Install project dependencies using dotnet sdk.
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

5. Setup the container for mySQL database.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

5. Run the project 
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the app in your web browser by visiting http://localhost:5000.

## Use

To test the endpoints you can acces to OpenAPI Swagger interactive documentation at http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html

Also you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or another software to test the API.
